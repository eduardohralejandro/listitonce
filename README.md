## List it once
 
 List it once app is an application which allows users from companies to create and manage their shopping list for their next event.

You can run this project with 

### `npm start` client folder.
### `npm start` in the root.

### `Main features`

- Add title to the list.
- You can add items to the list.
- Delete items while creating a list.
- Save list in the database.
- You can not save if all the information required is not completed(e.g you could not 
save in the database if the text input is empty).
- Display list in an organised way.
- Mark as bought (item).
- When checked item as bought you must add name, price and you can not save in the database 
if empty.
- UX desicions: auto focus in some of the inputs for better experience.

- Select recipes from API based in the ingredients on the list of the company.

### `Improvementes/features for next versions`
 
- A better css stucture, improve UI/mobile versions.
- We can edit an item + delete item after being saved - (login system: these actions can only be done by an admin)
- Save recipes.
- Logs.
- Delete an entire list(admin only).
- Delete items in the list (admin only).
- Search bar - find your list much more easily.
- Expenses tab: In this tab will be displayed the amount 
of the total money spent of all the employees every month of the year.
- Heroku deployment.

I think to continue the next weeks developing these features.
